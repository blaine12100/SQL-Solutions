Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

Assumption:

No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.
messages Table:
Column Name	Type
message_id	integer
sender_id	integer
receiver_id	integer
content	varchar
sent_date	datetime
messages Example Input:
message_id	sender_id	receiver_id	content	sent_date
901	3601	4500	You up?	08/03/2022 00:00:00
902	4500	3601	Only if you're buying	08/03/2022 00:00:00
743	3601	8752	Let's take this offline	06/14/2022 00:00:00
922	3601	4500	Get on the call	08/10/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
sender_id	message_count
3601	2
4500	1
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution:

SELECT sender_id, count(*) as message_count from messages WHERE sent_date between '08/01/2022' and '08/31/2022' group by sender_id order by count(*) desc limit 2
